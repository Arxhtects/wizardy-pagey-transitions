# WIZARDY PAGEY TRANSITIONS
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Arxhtects/wizardy-pagey-transitions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Arxhtects/wizardy-pagey-transitions)

This is my first plugin for wordpress and is purly designed to be opensource. The purpose of making the plugin was for ease of use in the company I currently work in. To easily adjust and edit code, and also have a lightweight plugin that doesnt have an effect on page speeds. 

# TODO
- Security enchancements
- ~~Add Options for different transitions~~
- Style settings panel
- Find a way to fetch css colors &/or set your own in settings
- Add html panel &/or options for setting a loading wheel or other loading things.
- Ajax async pages loading better for wordpress sites.

More todos to be added when I think of them

# INSTALLATION
> Put it in your projects plugin file [This plugin may get a proper release in the future]
##### Example:

##### If You get an error in your browser console. Its because the folder has "-master" on the end. Get rid of "-master", all will be good.
